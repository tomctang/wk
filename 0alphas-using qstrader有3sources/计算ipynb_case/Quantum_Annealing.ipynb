    "The optimal trading trajectory problem seeks to find the best strategy for trading a portfolio of assets over a given period of time, taking into account transaction costs, market impact, and other factors that affect the performance of the portfolio. In this paper, we present a solution to this problem using a quantum annealer, specifically the D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer."

    "### Applying Quantum Annealing to Options Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "Options trading presents a unique challenge due to the complexity of the financial derivatives and the various factors that influence their pricing. To apply quantum annealing to options trading, we would need to adapt the multi-period portfolio optimization problem to consider the characteristics of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **Problem Formulation**: In the context of options trading, the problem formulation should incorporate option-specific factors such as the option's type (call or put), strike price, time to expiration, implied volatility, and the underlying asset's price. Additionally, the Black-Scholes model or another option pricing model can be used to estimate the option's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **Objective Function**: The objective function should be designed to maximize the expected return from the options portfolio while considering transaction costs and risk exposure. This may include incorporating the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho), which measure the sensitivity of an option's price to various market factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **Constraints**: Constraints for options trading may include the trader's risk tolerance, capital limitations, position limits, and regulatory requirements. These constraints should be included in the problem formulation to ensure the optimal trading trajectory adheres to the trader's preferences and restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **Integer Encoding Schemes**: Adapt the integer encoding schemes to represent the options trading problem efficiently on a quantum annealer. This may involve designing new encoding schemes that can capture the unique aspects of options trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **Numerical Examples**: Perform numerical experiments to validate the quantum annealing approach for options trading. This will involve simulating options trading scenarios, running the quantum annealer, and analyzing the success rates of the optimized trading trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **Enhancements and Scalability**: As with the previous example, suitable software enhancements may be required to improve the results of the quantum annealing process in options trading. The scalability of the proposed formulation should also be considered, with the expectation that larger problems will be solvable as quantum annealing technology advances.\n",
